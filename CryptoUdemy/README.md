This app is made to practice Retrofit and RxJava. I used a [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atilsamancioglu/K21-JSONDataSet/master/crypto.json) from course instructor's github since official API website used in app is now offline.

Basically this app gets JSON data from an url with commands like GET. We use Retrofit and RxJava for this operation. Other than that, app only have one screen to display all crypto items. In this app, I learned how to send a get request to an API, create a model for Json data and handle response from that API. 

You can check out my codes and comments in them to have better understanding of how it works and what it does.
