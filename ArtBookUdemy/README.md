This Art Book project is coded during the course I took about Android Kotlin. It is for practicing databases with SQLite, getting gallery permissions from phone. Differently from the course, I used Fragments instead of activities and also for changing screens I used Navigation.

This app has 2 screens, one is home screen to list all art pieces to display. Other is to add art. In adding art screen, users first must get gallery permission, and then they can add whatever they want. You can see all items you added in home screen and in that list, you can click any item you want to see details of that item. Also app has a delete function in add screen to delete items if you want.

I practiced databases, fragments, navigation, adding options menu to the app, listing items with recyclerview and adapter.

You can see some images from app below:
