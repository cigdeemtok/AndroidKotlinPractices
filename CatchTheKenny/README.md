This is a simple game that I coded to practice basics of Kotlin Android development. This has one image of the Kenny in layout file and this view's x and y coordinates randomly changes to move the Kenny randomly.

You can score by trying to catch the Kenny by touching image view. I used CountDownTimer to track time and count down for the game. An alert dialog is shown after time is up. This way I also practiced alert dialogs.

You can see images from app below:
