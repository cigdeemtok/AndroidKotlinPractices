This simple game made using Kotlin is one of the projects that I made in the beginnig of my learning journey.

This app generates a random number thanks to Random library of Kotlin and user tries to guess that number. You have five chance to guess. Using buttons on the screen, you can send your guess and app tells you if you have a higher or less number input. If you guess correctly or you can't guess the number , a "Try Again" button shows up to restart the game.

If you want to check it out, clone the project and try it on your computer. You can keep track of random number using Logcat. 

You can see images from app below:
